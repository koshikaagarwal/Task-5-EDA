🔍 Key Insights:
Top-selling Products: Laptops and Mobiles generate the highest sales volume and revenue.
Customer Loyalty: A few customers like Vikas and Rahul have made multiple purchases.
Price Sensitivity: As product price increases, quantity sold decreases.
Outliers: High-value transactions exist — possibly bulk or premium purchases.
Correlation: Strong positive correlation between item price and total order value.
Average Order Value (AOV): Indicates typical customer spending behavior per purchase.
📈 Conclusion:The dataset reveals strong product and customer concentration — few high-value items and loyal customers contribute significantly to total revenue. The findings can guide inventory management, pricing, and marketing strategies.
